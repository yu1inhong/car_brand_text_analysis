 Real-word Trade-in Values of Car Brands
 
Get inspired by the idea of using social mentions for movies to predict box office outcomes (reference link: https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/two-thumbs-using-social-media-trends-anticipate-box-office-success), we construct this project with the aim to explore insights based on the analysis of social media conversations on a forum, and to form potential advice for brand manager, product manager and advertising manager based on our concrete analysis. 

To avoid bias on a particular product or brand, we get started by parsing data from general topics forums. We target on the latest 5000 comments on a forum related to real-world vehicle trade-in values (data source: https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/1212/general/x/real-world-trade-in-values). 


To make this project organized and well-constructed, we break it into three main aspects:

In the first session, we identify the top 10 brands by frequency, and look into the association between the brands by calculating lift ratios. Multidimensional scaling map is employed in this session for inspiration.

In the second session, we look into detail about the descriptions for vehicles and sum up with 11 attributes. Then we come up with the 5 most frequently mentioned attributes of cars in the discussion, and further explore those attributes that are significantly associated with the 5 most frequently mentioned brands. 

In the third session, we come up with the most aspirational brand in terms of people actually wanting to own and valuable business implications, based on the forum we choose.
